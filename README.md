# Clustering-Documents-using-k-Means-

When exploring a large set of documents such as Wikipedia, news articles etc it can be useful to get a list of related materials. 
To find relevant documents, we cluster similar kind of documents together and retrieve the documents that are most related 
to the given document( or to the document a user is currently reading in case of news article etc).This project uses the k means++ algorithm to cluster the documents.
(This mini-project is a part of Machine Learning specialization course, dataset or any pre-trained weights/models used were provided by Coursera.)
